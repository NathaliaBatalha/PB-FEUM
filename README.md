# PB-FEUM
This is a demonstration of the PB-FEUM, an algorithm capable of computing spatially varying distribution of material properties.

Please follow the steps:

1 - Please clone the repository. 
2 - Update the path on line 23 of 'Abaqus_script_100el.py'. The path should be where your repository is saved. 
3 - Choose the material properties file to be simulated, changing the .txt name on line 28 of 'Abaqus_script_100el.py'. 
4 - Open Abaqus Cae and run the script 'Abaqus_script_100el.py'. 
5 - Abaqus documentation provides the steps to export solutions, such as strain and stress fields. Please check: http://130.149.89.49:2080/v6.11/index.html
